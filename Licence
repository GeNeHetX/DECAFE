Process method for RNA sequencing output : Reads are aligned with the reference genome ensemblv107_GRCh38.75 (Homo sapiens samples) or ensemblv107_GRCm38.75 (Mus musculus samples) by STAR [1] and gene expression counts obtained with FeatureCount [2]. 

For differential analysis DESeq2 [3] estimates dispersions per gene and reduces these estimates to generate more precise dispersion estimates for the purpose of modeling counts. Next, DESeq2 fits the negative binomial model and performs hypothesis testing using the Wald test or the likelihood ratio test, and uses a p-value fitting method for multiple testing. For the application to the data, we used the Wald test recommended for studies with two conditions, and the p-value was adjusted using the Benjamini & Hochberg method.

GSEA [4] algorithm calculates the enrichment score (ES) using a statistic derived from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The ES measures the maximum deviation of a set of genes (belonging to a pathway) from a random distribution in the ranked list of peptides according to their association with the characteristic of interest. It thus quantifies the importance of the enrichment of the set of peptides in the ranked list and therefore the association of a protein with the characteristic of interest. It then assesses the statistical significance of the ES using a permutation test based on pathway membership. Protein membership tags are randomly permuted, and the ES is recalculated for the permuted data. This procedure is repeated to generate a null distribution of enrichment scores. By comparing the observed enrichment score with this null distribution, we can estimate a p-value that indicates the probability of obtaining such an extreme enrichment score by chance alone. Finally, because it evaluates multiple sets of genes, the GSEA algorithm performs a Benjamini and Hochberg multiple hypothesis testing correction. By normalizing the ES for each protein as a function of the number of peptides making it up, this gives a normalized enrichment score (NES).
